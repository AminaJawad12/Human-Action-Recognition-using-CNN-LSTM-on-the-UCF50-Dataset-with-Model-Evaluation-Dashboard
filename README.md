Human Action Recognition using CNN + LSTM is an end-to-end deep learning project on the UCF50 dataset that classifies human activities from video sequences. CNN extracts spatial features from frames, while LSTM captures temporal motion patterns. A results dashboard presents final accuracy and evaluation outputs.
