# Human Action Recognition using CNN–LSTM on the UCF50 Dataset with Model Evaluation Dashboard

Human Action Recognition using **CNN + LSTM** is an end-to-end deep learning project on the **UCF50 dataset** that classifies human activities from video sequences. **CNN** extracts spatial features from frames, while **LSTM** captures temporal motion patterns. A **results dashboard** presents final accuracy and evaluation outputs.
